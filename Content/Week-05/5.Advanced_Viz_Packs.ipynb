    "- Remember that our main interest is in similarity and clustering. Each joining (fusion) of two clusters is represented on the graph by the splitting of a horizontal line into two horizontal lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To interpret this graph, read it from a top-down perspective. Cluster leaves which linked together at a distance of zero fully predict one another's presenceâ€”one variable might always be empty when another is filled, or they might always both be filled or both empty, and so on. In this specific example the dendrogram glues together the variables which are required and therefore present in every record."
